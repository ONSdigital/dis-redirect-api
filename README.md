# dis-redirect-api

A Go API for management of redirects.

## Getting started

* Run `make debug` to run application on <http://localhost:29900>
* Run `make help` to see full list of make targets

### Dependencies

* No further dependencies other than those defined in `go.mod`

#### Tools

To run some of our tests you will need additional tooling:

##### Audit

We use `dis-vulncheck` to do Go auditing, which you will [need to install](https://github.com/ONSdigital/dis-vulncheck).

For Java auditing we use mvn `ossindex:audit` which requires you to [setup an OSS Index account](https://github.com/ONSdigital/dp/blob/main/guides/MAC_SETUP.md#oss-index-account-and-configuration) 
and make some updates to [Maven: Local Setup for ossindex:audit](https://github.com/ONSdigital/dp/blob/main/guides/MAC_SETUP.md#maven-local-setup-for-ossindexaudit)

##### Linting

We use v2 of golangci-lint, which you will [need to install](https://golangci-lint.run/docs/welcome/install).

##### Validating Specification

To validate the swagger specification you can do this via:

```sh
make validate-specification
```

To run this, you will need to run Node > v20 and have [redocly CLI](https://github.com/Redocly/redocly-cli) installed:

```sh
npm install -g redocly-cli
```
