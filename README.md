A Go API for management of redirects.

## Getting started

* Run `make debug` to run application on <http://localhost:29900>

* No further dependencies other than those defined in `go.mod`

#### Validating Specification

To validate the swagger specification you can do this via:

```sh
make validate-specification
```

To run this, you will need to run Node > v20 and have [redocly CLI](https://github.com/Redocly/redocly-cli) installed:

```sh
npm install -g redocly-cli
```
